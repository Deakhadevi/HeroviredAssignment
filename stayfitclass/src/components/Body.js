            <b>1. Measure and Watch Your Weight</b> 
    
            <br/>
            Keeping track of your body weight on a daily or weekly basis will help you see what you’re losing and/or what
            you’re gaining.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>2. Limit Unhealthy Foods and Eat Healthy Meals</b>
    
            <br/>
            Do not forget to eat breakfast and choose a nutritious meal with more protein and fiber and less fat, sugar, and
            calories. For more information on weight-control foods and dietary recommendations, please check the following
            <i><b>website: www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/diet-and-weight/. </b></i>

            <b>3. Take Multivitamin Supplements </b>
            <br/>
              To make sure you have sufficient levels of nutrients, taking a daily multivitamin supplement is a good idea,
              especially when you do not have a variety of vegetables and fruits at home. Many micronutrients are vital to your
              immune system, including <t> <b>vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and E, as well as zinc, iron, copper, selenium, and magnesium. </b></t>
              However, there’s currently NO available evidence that adding any supplements or “miracle mineral supplements”
              to your diet will help protect you from the virus or increase recovery. In some cases, high doses of vitamins can be
              bad for your health.
          <br/>
          <br/>
            <b>4. Drink Water and Stay Hydrated, and Limit Sugared Beverages </b>
            <br/>
            Drink water regularly to stay healthy, but there is NO evidence that drinking water frequently (e.g. every 15
            minutes) can help prevent any viral infection. For more information on drinking water and coronavirus, please
            check the following EPA website: www.epa.gov/coronavirus/coronavirus-and-drinking-water-and-wastewater.

            <b>5. Exercise Regularly and Be Physically Active </b>
            <br/>
     
              At this time, at-home workouts may be a good idea. But you can also walk your dog or run outside. Be sure you
              know what’s going on in your area and if there are any restrictions or mandatory self-quarantines. For more
              information on how to stay physically active while at home, please check the ACSM website: <b> <t> www.acsm.org/
                read-research/newsroom/news-releases/news-detail/2020/03/16/staying-physically-active-during-covid-19-pandemic. </t></b>

                <br/>
    
          <b>6. Reduce Sitting and Screen Time.</b>
    
            <br/>
            Exercise can’t immunize you from your sedentary time. Even people who exercise regularly could be at increased
            risk for diabetes and heart disease and stroke if they spend lots of time sitting behind computers. Practically
            speaking, you could consider taking breaks from sedentary time, such as walking around the office/room a couple
            of times in a day.
            <br/>
            <br/>
    
            <b>7. Get Enough Good Sleep  </b>
            <br/>
            
            There is a very strong connection between sleep quality and quantity and your immune system. You can keep your
            immune system functioning properly by getting seven to eight hours of sleep each night. For more information,
            please check the CDC website:<t><b>www.cdc.gov/sleep/index.html.  </b></t> 
            <br/>
            <br/>
    
            <b> 8. Go Easy on Alcohol and Stay Sober</b>
            <br/>
            Drinking alcohol does not protect you from the coronavirus infection. Don’t forget that those alcohol calories can
            add up quickly. Alcohol should always be consumed in moderation. Please see the recommendations by the AHA:
            www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/alcohol-and-heart-health.

            <b>9. Find Ways to Manage Your Emotions </b>
            <br/>
            It is common for people to have feelings of fear, anxiety, sadness, and uncertainty during a pandemic. To minimize
            stress-related weight gain, you use this information about stress and coping provided by the <t> <b>CDC: www.cdc.gov/
                coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-stress-anxiety.html.</b> </t>
